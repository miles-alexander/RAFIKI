# RAFIKI ‚Äì Guest Feedback Tracking & Reporting Tool üêí

## Overview

RAFIKI is a custom-built internal application designed to streamline the collection, categorization, and resolution of Guest feedback within Magic Kingdom Guest Relations. Developed using Microsoft PowerApps and SharePoint Lists, the tool enables real-time mobile and desktop entry of Guest issues and Cast compliments, providing a structured workflow for follow-up, reporting, and performance tracking.

The name RAFIKI is both a nod to Disney storytelling and an acronym that reflects the tool‚Äôs goals: **Recovery And Feedback Interactions for Knowledge and Improvement**.
